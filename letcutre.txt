#### Numeric Types - int, float, complex
https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex
NOTE: discuss variables
x + y sum of x and y     
x - y difference of x and y    
x * y product of x and y     
x / y quotient of x and y    
x // y  floored quotient of x and y (1)  
x % y remainder of x / y  (2)  
-x  x negated    
+x  x unchanged    
abs(x)  absolute value or magnitude of x    abs()
int(x)  x converted to integer  (3)(6)  int()
float(x)  x converted to floating point (4)(6)  float()
#### complex(re, im) a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero. (6) complex()
c.conjugate() conjugate of the complex number c    
divmod(x, y)  the pair (x // y, x % y)  (2) divmod()
pow(x, y) x to the power y  (5) pow()
x ** y  x to the power y

NOTE: Discuss print method

# Q14. What does z evaluate to?
z = 2 + 3 * 4

# Q15. What does z evaluate to?
z = (2 + 3) * 4

# Q16. What does z evaluate to?
z = 2 * (4 - 1)

# Q17. What does z evaluate to?
z = -(2 + 3)



#### Strings
String manipulation

1. Strings are created in differetne ways of type str
1.1 Single quotes
1.2 Double Quotes
1.3 Triple Quotes: expands over multiple lines, mostly used for comments

https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str
"Break it down like Tetris"

# indicate \n
# string indexes
# slicing
# len
# count
  # Finds out how many characters are in a string
  # "banana".count("n")
  # banana".count('n',3)
  # "banana".count('n',3,4)
  # "banana".count('n',3,5)
# endswith
  # suffix to see if it is true or not
# find
  # find where your substring starts
# format
  "We had {} Bananas, and now I ate {}".format(7, 3)
# split
# word.replace()
# lower
# upper
# capitalize
# strip
# Concatonation
# join
# isalpha()
# isdigit()

text = """Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."

First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright.

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air"""

Conditionals. Flow control
If some thing is true then action

While looks, infinite until false
For look, iterative look over a collection
